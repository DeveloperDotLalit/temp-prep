## **Topic 1.5: Theme, Typography, Colors, Shapes**

### **1. What It Is**

This topic covers the styling engine of Jetpack Compose, now based on **Material Design 3 (Material You)**. It is a centralized system where you define your app's "Brand DNA"—your colors, fonts, and corner roundness—in one place. The entire app then listens to these rules.

### **2. Why It Exists (The Consistency Problem)**

- **Problem:** In the old days, you might hardcode `Color.Red` in ten different XML files. If your brand changed to Blue, you had to find and replace it in ten places. Also, implementing Dark Mode required creating duplicate `values-night` XML files, which was messy.
- **Solution:** Compose uses a single source of truth. You wrap your app in a `MaterialTheme`. If you change the primary color in your definition, every Button, Checkbox, and TopBar in your app updates automatically. It also handles Dark Mode switch automatically by swapping the Color Scheme.

### **3. How It Works (The 3 Pillars)**

You typically find this in a file named `Theme.kt` (generated by Android Studio).

1. **Color Scheme (`ColorScheme`):** Defines semantic colors like `primary`, `secondary`, `background`, `error`. You define two sets: one for Light Mode, one for Dark Mode.
2. **Typography (`Typography`):** Defines text styles like `displayLarge`, `bodyMedium`, `labelSmall`. You set the font family, size, and weight here.
3. **Shapes (`Shapes`):** Defines how rounded corners are for `small`, `medium`, and `large` components (e.g., Buttons vs. Cards).

**The Hierarchy:**
All these are passed to the `MaterialTheme` composable at the root of your app.

```text
MaterialTheme
 ├── colorScheme (Colors)
 ├── typography (Fonts)
 └── shapes (Corner Radius)
      └── Your App Content (Everything inside inherits these styles)

```

### **4. Example: Setting up and Using a Theme**

**Step A: Define the Colors**

```kotlin
// Color.kt
val Purple80 = Color(0xD0BCFF)
val PurpleGrey80 = Color(0xCCC2DC)
val Pink80 = Color(0xEFB8C8)

// Theme.kt
private val DarkColorScheme = darkColorScheme(
    primary = Purple80,
    secondary = PurpleGrey80,
    tertiary = Pink80
)

private val LightColorScheme = lightColorScheme(
    primary = Color(0xFF6650a4),
    secondary = Color(0xFF625b71),
    tertiary = Color(0xFF7D5260)
)

```

**Step B: Apply the Theme**

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyAppTheme(
    darkTheme: Boolean = isSystemInDarkTheme(), // Auto-detects system setting
    content: @Composable () -> Unit
) {
    // Pick the right palette
    val colorScheme = if (darkTheme) DarkColorScheme else LightColorScheme

    MaterialTheme(
        colorScheme = colorScheme,
        typography = Typography,
        content = content
    )
}

```

**Step C: Use it in UI (The important part)**
Never hardcode colors! Always reference the theme.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyScreen() {
    // GOOD: Uses the theme. If you switch to Dark Mode, this automatically changes color.
    Text(
        text = "Hello World",
        color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary,
        style = MaterialTheme.typography.headlineMedium
    )

    // BAD: Hardcoded. Won't adapt to themes.
    // Text(text = "Hello World", color = Color.Blue)
}

```

### **5. Interview Prep**

**Interview Keywords**
MaterialTheme, ColorScheme, Dynamic Color, Typography / Type Scale, Design Tokens, Semantic Naming, Dark Mode support.

**Interview Speak Paragraph**

> "In Compose, theming is handled by the `MaterialTheme` composable, which acts as the single source of truth for the app's design system. Instead of hardcoding hex values or text sizes in individual views, we define `ColorScheme`, `Typography`, and `Shapes` globally. This makes implementing Dark Mode trivial—we simply swap the ColorScheme based on the system setting, and the entire UI adapts instantly. It also supports Material 3 features like Dynamic Color, where the app extracts colors from the user's wallpaper."

**Next Step:**
We have the environment and the styling ready. Now we need to write the actual code. Ready for **Topic 1.6: Understanding @Composable functions**? This digs deeper into the special rules of these functions.
