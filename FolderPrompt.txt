You are an expert documentation-automation assistant.

I will paste a phase-wise learning roadmap.
Your task is to generate a SINGLE PowerShell (.ps1) script that:

1. Creates a root folder named after the roadmap topic.
2. Creates one folder per phase using the phase title.
3. Inside each phase folder, creates Markdown (.md) files for EACH bullet point.
4. Markdown files MUST:
   - Be prefixed with numbers: 01_, 02_, 03_, etc. (based on bullet order)
   - Have meaningful, readable file names
5. Each Markdown file MUST start with EXACTLY this front-matter format
   (no extra fields) based on the levels:

The Front Matter Strategy (The "Glue")
"Just the Docs" builds the sidebar based on title, parent, grand_parent, and nav_order in the YAML Front Matter at the top of every Markdown file.

A. The Module Landing Page (docs/01-basics/index.md)
This file acts as the chapter cover. It must have has_children: true.

YAML

---
layout: default
title: 1. Introduction & Basics
nav_order: 1
has_children: true
permalink: /basics/
---

# Introduction to Jetpack Compose
(Executive summary of Module 1...)
B. A Topic Page (docs/01-basics/01-why-compose.md)
This file is a child of the Module.

YAML

---
layout: default
title: Why Compose?
parent: 1. Introduction & Basics
nav_order: 1
---

# Why Compose vs XML?
(Content generated by Gemini...)
C. A Deep Dive / Sub-Topic (docs/01-basics/deep-dive/internals.md)
If you need a 3rd level of nesting (e.g., specific "Internals" under a topic), use grand_parent.

YAML

---
layout: default
title: The Slot Table
parent: Why Compose?
grand_parent: 1. Introduction & Basics
nav_order: 1
---
6. The script must:
   - Be safe to re-run (do not overwrite existing files)
   - Work on Windows PowerShell
   - Use UTF-8 encoding
7. After generating the script, clearly explain:
   - How to save it as a .ps1 file
   - How to allow execution (temporary bypass)
   - How to run it
8. Output ONLY:
   - The final PowerShell script
   - The step-by-step instructions to run it
   - A short example of one generated markdown file

Also include:
- A root index.md landing page
- Phase landing pages
- Previous/Next navigation links

Now, I'll paste my roadmap input next
